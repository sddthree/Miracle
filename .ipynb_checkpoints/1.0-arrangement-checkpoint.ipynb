    "    * **Coding.** `Talk is cheap. Show me the code.` This is the famous quote from [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds). The best way to learn programming is to write code. This is the **most important** thing you learn any programming language. All the following tips are based on this golden rule.\n",
    "    * **Read code**. From the study of industry level code writen by experts you can learn a lot, e.g. how to design the system, syntax which are not taught in class, etc. The most popular site is [GitHub](https://github.com). You can easily `clone` the project into local computer and study the code.   \n",
    "    * **Sprit of solving problems.** When you run code, you will encounter uncountable unexpected `bugs`. Sometimes they are subtle and you may feel frustrated that the output is not what you expect. If you have watched the movie \"The Martian\", the below quotes may inspire you.\n",

    "> At some point, everything's gonna go south on you and you're going to say, this is it. This is how I end. Now you can either accept that, or you can get to work. That's all it is. You just begin. You do the math. You solve one problem and you solve the next one, and then the next. And If you solve enough problems, you get come home.\n",
